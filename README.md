# SkateSpotApp - Share and Discover Skatespots

**Note: Firestore and Google Maps api keys not included in this repository. This repository is only for demonstration purposes.**

SkateSpotApp! 🛹 This android app is designed for skateboarders to create and share skate spots with others around the world.

This app was made in the Kotlin language, and utilizes Cloud Firestore and Google Maps Platform API.  

## Features

- **User Login:** Users upon opening the app are asked to authorize themselves to Cloud Firestore.
- **Spot Sharing:** Upload skate spots that have a name, description, security level and geolocation associated with them. All entries are stored and retrieved from Cloud Firestore.
- **User Preferences** Change the settings of your app that are persistent through every session.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Users are able to view and add locations right in the app.
- **String Externalization:** All strings are stored externally, making it easier to add language support in the future.
